Learning is fun!

A few of my favorite things:
 
  Dogs! My dog's name is Mocha and she is 11. Half bassett, some rottie but, I say black and tan coonhound for insurance purposes.
  
  Coffee! I buy local and support my community whenever, wherever possible.
  
  Non-fiction! I recently started to introduce more fiction into my reading list. I also read at least 3 books at a time. 
  
  Hiking! I hope to section hike the AT some day. I also have in mind to somehow complete the Triple Crown: AT, PCT, CDT. I'm a 
   member of the Appalachion Mountain Club. I snowshoe.
  
  Kettlebells! Particularly KB juggling. Kind of how it sounds but not. Google it! The Russians do some crazy stuff. 
  
  Rollerblading!
  
  Dancing! I dance to free my soul. Seriously, in my living room. Every day. Always. :) I think virtual reality dancing with real                   musicians on stage at their live concerts is an awesome concept and I want to contribute to it in some way.
  
  Speaking! I am part of a speaker's club and I loooove it. 
  
  Writing! I have dreams of writing a book series based on past lives, intuition and how we 'become' when we land here on earth. 
  
  Shows I watch: Grey's Anatomy, Scandal, Gilmore Girls, to name just a few. I otherwise refuse to buy cable. 
  
  I eat primarily plant-based. So, yes, that's more or less vegetarian. I was vegan for 6 months in my 20's. I love cheese and 
    eggs!
    
  My favorite pizza is mushroom and black olive!
